Each of our sessions will be running online in real-time, via zoom. To access the talks, simply join the zoom associated with the room of your choice.

We also have a [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ausevo2022/shared_invite/zt-1lpv8sv00-ltuBOofLsdShHMJ5bGjO6w), where you can engage with each presenter and/or other audience members as the conference is going on (this is the same one as last year, so you may have already joined!). On this channel you can also find the schedule and any updates we will need to provide througout the conference.

#### Molonglo

This is the room we will use for all house-keeping, plenaries, tag-team and flash talks.
