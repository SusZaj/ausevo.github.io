AES 2022 will be a face-to-face conference (with online options) held at the Australian National University, Canberra.

We aim to provide a covid-safe, inclusive environment where Evolutionary Biologists can present their research and engage with each other in open discussions and friendly debates (please see Equity and Inclusion section below). We welcome people from all career stages, including parents and those that identify with traditionally under-represented groups.

Some small details of times might change, but the general schedule and starting/finishing times will be these. The conference will **start on the Wednesday Dec 14th at mid-day**.

#### Equity and Inclusion

We are really keen to create an open and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels welcome. We understand that conferences are not equally accessible to everyone, and we are aiming to be as inclusive as possible.

With this in mind,

-	We are looking into options of making a **parent/child friendly** conference, if you would like to bring your children, please indicate this when you register.

-	We will be providing **travel grants** to those in need. If you would like to be considered for one of these travel grants please indicate this when you register. 

-	Unfortunately Covid is still with us. To **reduce the risk of Covid** transmission during our conference we are taking a number of precautionary measures and we hope that everyone jumps on board, so that even vulnerable members of our community can enjoy themselves. It is up to us to commit and make this a safe environment for everyone.

**Covid precautions**

-	We will be checking that participants are **vaccinated upon registration**, only participants with full vaccination scheme (at least two doses) will be allowed to attend, and we highly encourage boosters.

-	We will be wearing **masks indoors** as per ANU policy. We recommend the use of KN95s or other highly protective masks.

-	We will provide **free RAT tests** to anyone that needs them, and we encourage attendees to get tested before the first day of the conference. In case of any symptoms (even if they are mild) please do not attend the venue. 

-	We will have **online options available** so that anyone who still feels uncomfortable, or who is ill can participate with conference activities.

If you feel that there is anything else we can do that would make you feel more comfortable attending AES2022, please get in touch, we are very open to suggestions.
