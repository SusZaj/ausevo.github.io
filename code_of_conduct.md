**AES** is dedicated to providing a safe, hospitable, and productive environment for all members. Accordingly, AES prohibits all forms of discrimination and harassment (including among member, volunteers, and staff) in all Society activities, including events (online or in person), journal correspondence, social media, etc). Behaviour that undermines the integrity of intellectual discourse is an impediment to scientific progress and will not be tolerated. Unacceptable treatment of others includes (but is not limited to) harassment, stalking, belittling, discrimination, bullying/intimidation, assault, trolling, and retaliation (see below for descriptions). Any misconduct on the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or other descriptive category will not be tolerated.
Violations of the code of conduct can be reported and following an investigation consequences can range from notification/ warning to the offender to expulsion from current and/or future events or blocking social media accounts (see Implementation, Compliance, and Reporting [below]).
