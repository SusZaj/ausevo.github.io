We have sourced some cheaper accommodation options on Campus (<10min walk from our conference venue). If you would like to stay at these places, contact them directly.

**Burgmann College**: $70 pp/pn, includes all meals! (Not that youâ€™ll need them with our yummy conference catering), and has shared bathrooms. Please contact Margaret Cadman. Margaret.Cadman@burgmann.anu.edu.au

**John III College**: $100 pp/pn, includes breakfast. Please contact enquiries@johnxxiii.anu.edu.au

There also are plenty of other hotel options around, pick something near the ANU campus for easy access. One potential option is:

**The [Canberra Accommodation Centre](https://canberra-accommodation.com.au)**. This is an off-campus accommodation option, but it is close to Braddon night life and on the tram line, so still convenient. Single rooms are \$98 / night and twin rooms (2 people) are \$138 / night ($69 / person / night). To book, you can do so online through this [link](https://app.mews.com/distributor/77a6d5b1-05f2-4df3-bcaa-af17003c0e3f?mewsAvailabilityBlockId=1882ff91-ea6d-4698-b35b-af1700381f89).
