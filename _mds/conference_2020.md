## AES 2021 is coming!

We are going entirely virtual to host the **Australasian Evolution Society conference** this year. 

The meeting will be held on via two concurrent [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) sessions   
### 3rd and 4th of December, 2020.

This conference aims to provide a friendly environment for everybody, including students, female researchers and minority groups, to present their evolutionary research work.   
Thus, the Organisers warmly encourage early career researchers (especially students), women and any under-represented minorities, to apply for Long Talks and also to communicate any special needs or accommodations you may require during this event.   

Applications for Student and Early Career Awards are now open [here!](http://ausevo.com/prizes/).   

Registration and Abstract submisson has opened **June 2020** and will close in **November 2020**
