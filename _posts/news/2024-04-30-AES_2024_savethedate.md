### Save the date for this year’s Australasian Evolution Society Conference!

It will be held from **Wednesday 4th December to Friday 6th December 2024 (inclusive) on University of Western Australia’s campus in Perth WA**. Hosted by Renée Firman (Vice President) and co, it’s going to be a great occasion to enjoy the delights of our West coast while celebrating our excellent evolutionary research. We hope you can take the opportunity to spend a few days extra in the region.

### Early-career travel grants:

We will offer travel grants again this year to support early-career researchers. You spoke and we listened – these will be opened in two weeks’ time (details to come shortly) and will close mid June, for announcement early July so you can start planning the trip. 

### Early-career research grants:

As the conference is in Western Australia, the committee has decided to invest more in travel grants this year. Therefore, we will not be opening research grants in 2024. However, we will be offering ECR prizes and awards in 2024. Details of those to come.

### Conference registration:

This will open in early July. We aim to offer similar costings as previous years, so please see the website for those details. As in previous years, for talk presentations we do not request an abstract on application, only a title. All talks will be scheduled, and we encourage especially ECRs to apply. We hope to run tag-team presentations again, as well as the usual standard and flash talk options. 

Looking forward to seeing you all in Perth in December!
