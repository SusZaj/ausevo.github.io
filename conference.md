# AES 2022 is coming!

#### We are super excited to announce that out annual AES conference will be happening in Canberra, from the 14th to the 16th of December.

We have secured a great venue at ANU, and really hope that you all can come and end the year with both great science and great company. If itâ€™s unfeasible for you to come, we will also do our best to have an online option so you can still join us. 
 
We will be opening registration in a couple of months so please keep an eye open for that, as well as announcements about travel support for ECRs.
