# AES 2021 is coming!

#### The conference will take place between the 1st and 3rd of December 2021. 

AES 2021 will be a hybrid face-to-face/virtual meeting held at **Monash University’s Clayton Campus in Victoria**. We aim to provide an inclusive environment for Evolutionary Biologists at all career stages, including parents and those of us that identify with traditionally under-represented groups, so we can present our evolutionary research work and engage in friendly discussion and debate.

Abstracts are due **November 1st**, registration link [HERE](https://aes.corsizio.com/c/6141a39502de2a7ff2f3f120)

## FAQs  

**Can I give a talk even if I can’t make it to the face-to-face conference?**

Yes, we expect Victorians will be able to give their talk and attend in person, but if you have been accepted for a talk and can’t make it from another state, you will be able to give your talk remotely. We will do our best to have a dual-delivery system, so that even if you present remotely you will be able to interact with both live and online audiences.

**I am getting a bit sick of online conferences, how will this be different?**

We would prefer that everyone could come to the conference but we realise this is going to be difficult for those outside Victoria, so to make this conference inclusive, we want to make online participation possible. As many of you who have taught hybrid classes will know, hybrid meetings are difficult because the online participants cannot ask questions and follow everything that is going on in the room. We are going to try and solve this with technology. We hope to have cameras that follow the speaker, microphones that pick up the questions from the room, and speakers and big screens in the room so that the online participants can be seen and heard. For an example of how this could work, check out some short videos on the [Owl system](https://owllabs.com).

**What about posters?**

Instead of posters we will have 3 minute lightning talks, with slides. Each round of lightning talks will have a period for extended questions afterwards.

**What is a tag-team talk?**

The tag-team talks are an opportunity for a few members from the same group or collaboration to present different aspects of the same project. These talks will take advantage of a group-leader's experience and deep understanding of the background of a project to introduce the talk, and to introduce the students and/or ECRs who will present specific sub-projects or experiments. As far as we know, this is a new way of presenting. We think this will provide an exciting opportunity for a group to work together on providing a narrative thread that ties together the people and experiments that together make a project. And, it should also be fun for the speakers to put together and for the listeners to hear about!

We envision there being 2-3 Tag Team Talks that will take place in the morning plenary session.

One person (lab head) will give an intro to the project and introduce the other speaker(s) (~7 mins). The student or postdoc presenters will then present individual experiments/sub-projects that follow the same theme (~20 mins). We think having 2 or 3 postdoc/students would work well. Finally, there will be a wrap up from the lab head (3 mins), for a total of ~30 mins.
