#### Opening night social event

Badger and Co (5.30pm) - drinks and food provided.

#### Successes, rejections and lessons as an ECR

Barton theatre (5 - 6.30pm)

The aims of this informal chat are to (a) help ECRs feel that they are not alone, and that we all have failures and hurdles; and (b) help ECRs find a good perspective and discuss strategies/approaches people have used to deal with the high stress
environment. We will have a panel of early-mid career researchers followed by an informal Q&A/ discussion in which the audience can participate.

Organisers: Sara Ryding & Rowan Lymbery
