These awards give the community the opportunity to hear some of the most exciting science done by our early career researchers. Applying is extremely easy, because youâ€™ve already done the hard work. All you need to do is **submit your best/favourite paper** and provide a statement of contribution and impact. **Preprints can be submitted too**.  
 
We will select our favourite publications and invite the authors (ECR who submitted) to give a 30 minute plenary at our AES conference in Canberra. AES will cover registration (will refund if you already paid) and provide $250 towards accommodation. 
 
There will be two categories, one for post-doctoral researchers and one for grad students. 
 
Outcomes will be announced the first week of November. -->
