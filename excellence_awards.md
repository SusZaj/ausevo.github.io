These awards give the community the opportunity to hear some of the most exciting science done by our early career researchers. Applying is extremely easy, because youâ€™ve already done the hard work. All you need is to **submit your best/favourite paper** and provide a statement of contribution and impact. **Preprints can be submitted too**.  
 
We will select our favourite publications and invite the authors (ECR who submitted) to give a 30 minute plenary at our AES conference in Canberra. AES will cover registration (will refund if you already paid) and provide $250 towards accommodation. 
 
There will be two categories, one for post-doctoral researchers and one for ECRs **Iliana - does this mean PhDs and below?**. 
 
Please apply [here](https://melbourneuni.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eS57ehtxYoLNqAK) by the 20th of October. Outcomes will be announced the first week of November.
